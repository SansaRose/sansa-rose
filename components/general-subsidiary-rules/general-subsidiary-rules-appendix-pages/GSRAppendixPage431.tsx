                            <p>Reserved bogies occupied by passengers and inspection carriages/saloons occupied by VIPs, should be treated as any other passenger coach and marshaled accordingly.

If they are wooden bodied, they should be marshaled inside the required number of anti-telescopic/steel bodied coaches. If shunting time required to comply with this marshalling is likely to be long, attaching/detaching of such coaches may be made at convenient points and the party advised to entrain/detrain at their destination en route.</p>
