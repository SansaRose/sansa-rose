Limit Board.—
(1) On a single line class ‘B’ station worked on the Absolute Block System,
if the obstructing of the line outside the Home signal or the outermost
facing points in the direction of an approaching train is permitted
under special instructions under Rule 8.09, a Shunting Limit Board or
an Advanced Starter shall be placed at such shunting distance from
the Home signal or the outermost facing points as local conditions may
require, provided the distance between the Shunting Limit Board
(bearing the words ‘Shunting Limit’ on the side which faces the station, and fitted with a lamp showing a white light in both directions
to mark its position by night) or the Advanced Starter and the opposing
first Stop signal is never less than 400 metres in the two-aspect
signalling territory and 180 metres in the multiple-aspect or modified
lower quadrant signalling territory. The location of such board or
Advanced Starter shall mark the limit up to which shunting may be
permitted.
(2) On a double line Class ‘B’ station worked on Absolute Block System
equipped with multiple-aspect or modified lower quadrant signalling
and where there are no points or the outer most points at the
approaching end are trailing, a Block Section Limit Board (bearing the
words ‘Block Section Limit’ on the side which faces the station and
fitted with a lamp showing white light in both directions to mark its
position by night) shall be provided. It shall be placed at a distance of
not less than 180 metres in advance of the Home signal and shall
protect the fouling mark of the outermost trailing points, if any. The
location of such board shall mark the limit of the block section at such
stations.`}
