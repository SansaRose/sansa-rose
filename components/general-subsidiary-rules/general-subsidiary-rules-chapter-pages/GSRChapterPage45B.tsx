                    {`3.36. Fixed signals generally.—
(1) Every fixed signal shall be so constructed that, in case of failure of
any part of its connections, it shall remain at, or return to its most
restrictive aspect.
(2) A signal which has been taken ‘off’ for the passage of a train shall not
be placed to ‘on’ until the whole of the train which it controls has
passed it, except—
(a) in case of emergency to avert an accident,
(a(a)) Where Starter and Advanced Starter taken ‘off’ for departing
trains that is trains starting from station after coming to stop are
required to be put back for the purpose of movement of another
train for precedence or crossing shall be put back only after
taking following precautions:-
(i) relevant Starter and Advanced Starter may be replaced to ‘on’
position and thereafter the Loco Pilot of the train for which
the signals had been taken ‘off’ shall be advised by on-duty
station Master through a secured means of communication,
specified under special instructions, or where secured means
of communication are not available, through a written memo
to the effect that the said signals have been replaced to ‘on’
and that the Loco Pilot shall not start.
(ii) till the Loco Pilot has been advised through secured means of
communication referred to in sub-clause (i) or through written
memo and his acknowledgement received, the route set shall
not be altered except to avert an accident; or
(b) Where arrangement is provided to restore the signal to ‘on’
automatically, the control operating the signal shall not be
restored to its normal position till the whole of the train has
passed it.
(3) No fixed signal within station limits shall be taken ‘off’ without the
permission of the Station Master and in the case of a signal outside
the station limits without the permission of such person as may for the
time being be in independent charge of the working of such signal.
S.R.3.36.1. Taking ‘off’ the approach Stop signals can be delayed to ensure busy level
crossing gates, if any, are closed only for 10 minutes before the arrival of the train, to avoid
complaints from road users.
S.R. 3.36.2 The Station Master shall assure himself, in all cases either personally or by
means of the repeater that the concerned signals, governing the movement of a train, are
taken ‘off ‘ for the train correctly and such signals are put back to ‘on’ immediately after the
train has completely passed the signal. However, the position of the points shall not be
changed, until the whole train has either come to a stop at the station or run through the
station, except where sectional route release facility is provided.
S.R. 3.36.3.1. Testing of Reception signals:
At interlocked stations with two cabins, one on either side, where signal reversers are
provided and the taking ‘off’ of the reception and dispatch signals controlled by means of
control knobs in the Station Master’s office and slot knob control in the cabin, the Station
Master shall daily, during day time, when no train is due to arrive or leave the station, test the
working of the reception signals in one direction for one line as for a stopping train. For
example, at a station with two running roads the signals shall be tested as under-
S.R. 3.36.3.1.1. The Station Master shall arrange for the taking ‘off’ of the Up reception
signals for road No.1. He shall then put back his control knob and personally see whether the
reception signals have gone back to ‘on’ position. The Station Master at the station shall
again arrange for the taking ‘off’ of the Up reception signals for road No. 1 and instruct the
Station Master in the Cabin to put back the cabin slot knob to normal and personally see
whether the reception signals have gone back to ‘on’ position.
S.R. 3.36.3.1.2. The Station Master at the Station shall similarly test on the second day, the
Down reception signals for road No. 1 and on the third day, the Up reception signals for road
No. 2. On the fourth day, the Down reception signals for road No. 2 and so on, every day
repeating the procedure laid down in para 3.1.1. above.
S.R. 3.36.3.2. The Station Masters shall immediately after each test, record the results of the
test in the Station Diary. If the signals do not go back to ‘on’ position when the Station
Master’s control knob/button or cabin slot is restored to its normal position, the signal shall be
treated as defective and immediate action taken as laid down in the General Rules 3.68 and
3.69 and Subsidiary Rules there under.
S.R. 3.36.3.3.This procedure of testing the reception signals shall also be adhered to at
stations provided with a central cabin with Station Master’s control knobs/buttons in the
Station Master’s office. At stations where Cabin Station Masters are in-charge of cabins, the
Station Masters of such stations shall similarly test the working of the reception signals daily
and record the results of the tests in the Station Diary maintained in the cabin.
S.R. 3.36.3.4. Inspecting Officials shall, whenever they inspect the stations, check the
Station Diary and ensure that these rules (Paras 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) are being carried out
scrupulously.
S.R. 3.36.4. Under Special Instructions, certain Goods yards are declared as ‘terminal yards’
for the purposes of reception and dispatch of goods trains and regulating goods yard
shunting. At such terminal yards, stop boards are provided on each goods reception line and
adequate distance for reception is reckoned, with the approval of Authorized Officer from the
Stop Board to fouling mark at the trailing end. Wherever the Stop Board is fixed at the fouling
mark, the adequate distance for taking ‘OFF’ Home is reckoned as zero. Speed of incoming
trains inside the station section shall be restricted to 15 KMPH except where train has to
negotiate turnout having 1 in 8 ½ straight switch where Speed is restricted to 10 KMPH and
requisite speed restriction Boards are duly exhibited below the respective Home signals. The
Station Working Rules of such ‘terminal yards’ will clearly specify the procedure to be
followed for reception and dispatch of goods trains and regulation of shunting movements.
The trailing points on the line, on which a Goods train is to be received should be set and
padlocked against the line (in case of mechanically interlocked stations), so that no
conflicting reception or shunting movement is permitted. The Station Working Rules shall
clearly specify the staff responsible to ensure this. (Item No.1 of AS-21 Dt:03.06.25)
S.R. 3.36.5. If in an emergency, a reception signal has to be placed to ‘on’ position before
the arrival of the train to which it refers, no points shall be altered until the train has come to a
stand except to prevent an accident.
S.R. 3.36.6. Certificate of competency – Shunting Master/Pointsmen.
Every Shunting Master/ Pointsmen shall be tested after completion of initial/refresher training
course and be issued with a certificate of competency by the in charge of the training centre
in the form No. T.336 before he is put to work independently. The certificate of competency
will be valid for a period of 3 years from the date of issue.`}
