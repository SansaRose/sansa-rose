(1) All points shall normally be set for the straight except when otherwise
authorized by special instructions.
(2) The railway servant concerned with the operation of points and
signals shall not, while on duty, leave the place of operation of points
or signals which are under his charge except under special
instructions.
(3) No railway servant shall interfere with any points, signals, or their
fittings, signal wires or any interlocking or block gear for the purpose
of effecting repairs, or for any other purpose, except with the previous
permission of the Station Master.
SR 3.51.1. Any railway servant on duty in a non-block cabin who has received instructions
for the admission or dispatch of a train shall continue to be on duty till the arrival or departure
of the train. If there is any unusual delay for arrival or departure of the train, the Station
Master shall arrange to relieve the railway servant and ensure that the reliever understands
his duties.
SR 3.51.2.1. If at any time during his hours of duty, the Station Master in-charge of a signal
cabin where block instruments are placed finds it necessary, in order to comply with safety
rules, to leave the cabin temporarily, he shall specially depute a responsible railway servant
to remain in the cabin or close and lock up the cabin.
SR 3.51.2.2. Whenever, in an emergency, points, signals or any other safety appliances
have to be left unattended, they shall be secured in their position by the means provided.
SR 3.51.2.3. Pointsmen in cabin or staff-in-charge of points or signals shall not leave their
posts, unless they are relieved.
SR 3.51.3.1. At certain stations, point indicators are provided. They are not signals but are
appliances fitted to and working with points to indicate by day or by night the position in
which the points are set. All the Point indicators shall show a white target by day or a white
light by night in both directions when the points are set for the straight and no target by day
and a green light by night in both directions when the points are set for the turnout.
SR 3.51.3.2. At non-interlocked stations and stations provided with rudimentary interlocking,
the Station Master and Loco Pilot shall satisfy themselves by the indications of the Point
indicator that the points have been correctly set.
SR 3.51.3.3.1. At interlocked stations in Multiple-Aspect Signalling territory, provided with a
single arm Home signal, the Station Master and the Loco Pilot of an incoming train, should
observe the point indicator to make certain that a Home signal has been taken ‗off‘ only for
the route on which the train is to be received.
SR 3.51.3.3.2. At other interlocked stations, the Station Master need not observe the point
indicator to satisfy himself that the points are correctly set during the reception of trains if
bracketed Home signals have been provided and during dispatch of trains, if Starter signals
have been provided.
SR 3.51.3.4. When signal becomes defective (interlocked and non-interlocked stations), the
Station Master shall personally make sure that the points are correctly set, clamped and
locked. The Loco Pilot and also the Station Master shall observe the Point indicator,
wherever available.
SR 3.51.4. No work necessitating interference with points, lock bars, detectors, signals or
other interlocking gear which are likely to affect the safety of trains or traffic shall be
commenced except with the consent of the Station Master.
SR 3.51.5. A signal maintainer whether Block, Electrical or Mechanical shall be in
possession of a certificate of competency declaring that he understands all the relevant rules
and instructions pertaining to his duties and is competent to undertake the work which may
necessitate interference with points, lock bars, detectors, signals etc., and independently
may also undertake such work except interference with locking arrangements in an
interlocked frame. This certificate of competency shall be issued by the Principal/STTC/ MLY
after successful completion of Initial Course/Refresher Course, which is valid for a period of
four years. As a temporary measure, DSTE/ADSTE of the Division can extend the validity of
Competency Certificate for one year. However, only one such extension is permissible.
SR 3.51.6 The Signal Inspector or the person in-charge of the work shall before taking in
hand any work in connection with a lever frame, points, signals, lock bars or detectors etc.,
involving disconnection or removal of interlocking gear of any kind, advise the Station Master
in writing in Form S&T (T/351) (Disconnection Notice) and obtain the signature of the Station
Master on the copy of ‗Acknowledgement of disconnection/reconnection notice‘.
In the case of joint works involving Engineering department, a special mention may be made
in the form S&T (T/351) as ―Joint-work with Engineering department‖. The Station Master‘s
signature on the acknowledgement copy is the authority for the signal branch to commence
the work. Where cabins are under the control of Station Master, he must advise the cabin
staff giving the particulars of the point which is disconnected, under the exchange of Private
Numbers. After the work is completed, the person in-charge of the work shall issue
Reconnection Notice to the Station Master. On receipt of the reconnection notice, Station
Master shall jointly test along with the person in-charge of the work the proper working of the
reconnected gears. If satisfied on proper working, the Station Master shall then
acknowledge the reconnection notice. The signature of the person in-charge of the work on
the reconnection notice is the authority for the Station Master to resume normal working.
(S. No. 1 of AS-10 dated 10.08.2023).
S.R. 3.51.7.1. In the interval between disconnection and reconnection, if it is necessary to
pass the trains or perform shunting movements, the Station Master on duty shall advise the
Signal Inspector or the person in charge of the works by a memo stating in which position the
points are to be set. The Station Master or other authorized staff on his behalf with the
permission of the Signal Inspector or the person in charge of the work shall arrange to set
and clamp the points in the desired position for the safe passage of the trains. The relevant
signals shall be placed at ‗on‘ by the staff of S&T branch. In the case of joint works,
permission of the PWI or his authorized staff also has to be obtained in advance by the S&T
branch. Shunting moves are to be avoided as far as possible. If the disconnection of points is
made at one end of the cross over, the points at the both ends of the cross-over should be
treated as having been disconnected and should be clamped and padlocked by the Station
Master and trains passed over the same by piloting. It should be ensured that the other end
of the cross-over shall also be set, clamped and padlocked for isolation of the train, which
passes on the straight road. The other end should be set and clamped for the cross-over
movement, if the movement is over the cross-over.
S.R. 3.51.7.2. It shall be the duty of the Station Master or any authorised person on his
behalf to ensure that the points are set and clamped for the correct route. He will then put
the padlock on the clamp to prevent any interference therewith until the completion of the
train or the shunting movement, as the case may be. Cotter bolting wherever available is
also permissible with padlocking.
S.R. 3.51.7.3. The cotter, bolt or clamp should be removed by the Station Master or the
authorized person after the completion of the train or shunting movement and then the Signal
Inspector or the person in charge of the work can resume work on the gear.
S.R. 3.51.7.4. On completion of the Engineering work, a certificate to the effect that the
Engineering works have been completed and track is safe for the passage of the train shall
be given by the Engineering official to the Signal Inspector/Maintainer, in charge of the work
with a copy to the Station Master. Only after the receipt of this certificate, reconnection notice
shall be issued by the S&T staff.
S.R. 3.51.8. Except under special instructions issued by the DRM, wherever the points or
signals or interlocking gears are disconnected in terms of S.R. 3.51.6 the concerned
points/interlocking gear shall be treated as out of order. The relevant signals shall be placed
at ‗on‘ by the staff of the S&T branch.
S.R. 3.51.9.1. Whenever it is necessary for Signal Inspector or a duly certified and
competent Signal Maintainer to carry out tests of signal appliances of any description, he
shall make an entry in the station diary or cabin diary stating the particulars of work to be
done and the time required. The Station Master shall countersign this entry and add any
remark he may consider necessary regarding the movement in the yard etc., before the work
is taken on hand.
S.R. 3.51.9.2. After the Inspecting Official has given such notice, the Station Master shall
advise the cabin staff and get their acknowledgements by obtaining a Private Number for
carrying out the test and record the Private Number in the diary. No move which would lead
to the end of the yard where testing is in progress shall then be carried out, without first
obtaining the permission of the Station Master. This permission shall not be given by the
Station Master until the official carrying out the test has been advised and his
acknowledgement obtained in writing and all testing relating to the line on which the
movement is to take place has been stopped. Such permission shall be conveyed by
communication of a Private Number.
S.R. 3.51.9.3 The Loco shed shall be advised that engine movements towards the Traffic
Yard shall not be allowed without the permission of the Station Master. A banner flag
preceded by a Stop hand signal shall also be provided at the exit from the Loco Yard under
the orders of the official carrying out the test, in the absence of a fixed signal controlling such
exit.`}
