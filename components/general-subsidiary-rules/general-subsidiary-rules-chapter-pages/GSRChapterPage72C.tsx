(1)(a) All Station Masters, Guards, Loco Pilots, Gang mates,
Gatemenand all other railway servants on whom this duty is laid
by theRailway Administration, shall keep a stock of detonators.
(b) The Railway Administration shall be responsible for the supply,
renewal, periodical testing and safe custody of such detonators,
and for ensuring that their use is properly understood.
(2) Every railway servant concerned with the use of detonators shall have
a correct knowledge of their use and keep them ready for immediate
use.
(3) Every railway servant shall see that the railway servants in his charge
concerned with the use of detonators have a correct knowledge of
their use.
S. R. 3.64.1 Stock of detonators
(1) A case containing 10 detonators shall form part of the equipment, when on
duty, of every Guard, of every Loco Pilot on the footplate, of every Gangmate,
of every Gateman, of every Bridge Guard, of every Cutting Guard, of every
Patrolman and of every push trolley, motor trolley and lorry and 8 detonators
for every Key man.
(2) The DRM shall prescribe the number of detonators which shall be kept in
stock at station and the minimum number below which the stock shall not be
allowed to fall.
(3) The DRM shall prescribe the number of detonators which shall be kept in
stock in each PWI’s office and Running Sheds respectively and also the
minimum number below which the stock shall not be allowed to fall.
(4) Station Masters, Chief Crew Controllers (CCC) and PWIs are responsible for
ensuring that the stock of detonators is never allowed to fall below the
minimum.
S.R. 3.64.2.Supply of Detonators.
(1) Station Masters will supply detonators to Guards headquartered at their
stations and to Gatemen working under their control.
(2) PWIs shall supply detonators to Gangmates, Keymen, Gatemen (not covered
in 2.1 above), Bridge Guards, Cutting Guards and Patrolmen.
(3) CCC will supply detonators to Loco Pilots.
(4) The users of push trolley, cycle /moped trolley, motor trolley, lorries shall
arrange for thesupply of detonators either direct from the DRM or through the
Station Masters, PWIs or CCCs of their headquarter station, as may be
convenient.
S.R. 3.64.3. Storage of detonators.
(1) Detonators shall be carefully handled as they are liable to explode if roughly
handled.
(2) Detonators shall be kept in tin cases specially supplied and they shall be
stored in dry places and not left in contact with the brick walls, damp wood,
chloride of lime or other disinfectants nor exposed to dampness or steam or
other vapors.
(3) The month and year of manufacture is shown on the label outside each
case and is also stamped on each detonator. Detonators shall be used in
the order of the dates stamped on them, those of the oldest date being
always used first. To facilitate ready withdrawal in this sequence they should
be stored also accordingly.
S.R. 3.64.4. Use of detonators.
(1) For use, a detonator shall be placed on the centre of the head of the rail with
the label or brand of the detonator upwards, and shall be securely fastened to
the rail by bending the clasps attached with the detonators, round the upper
flange of the rail.
(2) Station Masters, CCCs and PWIs are responsible for ensuring that the
detonators in possession of the railway servants under them are tested as
prescribed under the rules and that the staff know how and when to use them.
For Gatemen within station limits, this responsibility will lie with the Station
Master or Traffic Inspector of the section. Such staff as are expected to use
the detonators should be tested once in three months by the Inspecting
Officials and Senior Subordinates in regard to their knowledge of use of
detonators.
(3) Each Station Master, CCC and PWI will maintain a register of receipts, use
and testing of detonators in respect of railway staff to whom the detonators
were issued by him`

                    At stations, loco sheds, etc., where stocks of detonating signals are kept for issue to Guards, Loco Pilots, Fog Signalmen or other railway staff, the Station Master, Crew Control Centre (CCC), or other person in charge must test at least one detonator from every tin case issued. The resultant deficiency in each tin must be made good by replacing from another tin of which a detonator has been tested.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Traffic Inspectors, Station Masters, CCCs, and Permanent Way Inspectors (PWIs) are responsible to ensure that all detonators held by railway staff under their jurisdiction are tested at least once every 12 months.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Detonators manufactured during 2010 and afterwards have a normal life of 5 years from the year of manufacture. The life can be extended by up to 3 additional years—provided detonators older than 5 years prove effective in tests. For this, 2 detonators from each batch must be tested after 5 years. If satisfactory, extend life by one year, repeating the test annually for a maximum life of 8 years. If these additional tests are unsuccessful, detonators must be destroyed. (For detonators manufactured prior to 2010: the normal life remains 7 years, with extension possible following tests.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Detonators showing any rust, signs of unsatisfactory condition, or failing to explode during tests or service, must be promptly returned to the issuing officer for replacement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When testing detonators from a tin, always use the oldest detonator (by date of manufacture).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Detonators should be tested under an empty wagon moving at 8 to 11 km/h, propelled by a locomotive. Only Traffic Inspectors, PWIs, Loco Inspectors, CCCs, or Station Masters at Guard’s headquarters are authorized to carry out these tests. Ensure the test site is not crowded or near a level crossing to prevent injury from flying fragments.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Except for the locomotive crew involved, no person is allowed within a 45-metre radius of the detonator being tested. The engine crew must remain inside the cab while passing over the detonator. The supervising official must ensure this safety radius is maintained by posting sufficient staff before the test begins.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While maintaining the 45-metre safety radius, staff should position themselves as far as possible to the rear of the train or wagon passing over the detonator, since fragments typically fly forward.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A special register must be maintained at each testing site, recording the number and test results of detonators tested.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After completing the test, the official must communicate the test results to the issuing officer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Detonators in possession of staff must not be used for any improper purpose.
