However, running staff may move in such sections with a restricted speed of 40 kmph during day and when view ahead is clear and 15 kmph during night and when view ahead is not clear, for the first trip only, to acquaint themselves with new signalling positions, sectional gradients and new infrastructure in the section&quot;. (Item no. 3 of AS 05 dated 13.12.2022).

                        Divisions shall ensure display of the location of new signals and sectional gradients in the crew booking offices for a period of 90 days, so that running staff will get prior information about the infrastructure in the newly added sections such as 2nd/3rd/4th line or new Automatic Block Signalling sections.

                      <p>
                        (f) On promotion to or officiating as LP (Goods), road learning as prescribed in SRs 3.78.2.(a) to 3.78.2 (c) has to be provided to Loco-pilot to understand train dynamics.

A Loco-pilot/ Assistant Loco-pilot/Guard should record in the register 15 days in advance that he is lapsing road learning in a section. The base depot should also keep a record of the date of the last trip performed by a Loco-pilot/ Assistant Loco-pilot/Guard on different sections and update it every first of the month. On the basis of these records, depot in-charge should book Loco Pilot/Assistant Loco Pilot/Guard for road learning on a section where it is required.
