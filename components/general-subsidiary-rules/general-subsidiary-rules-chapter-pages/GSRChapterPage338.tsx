                              persons. All operation of sectioning or isolating switches shall be reported to the

                              occurrence on overhead equipment or unusual occurrences on overhead feeders
                              or high tension cables etc., or any occurrence affecting the working of trains and

                              inform the TPC who shall take necessary action for any switching operations
                              which may be necessary on the overhead equipment or at sub-stations and
                              immediately inform the DEE/Tr.D and other concerned officials.</li>
                              <li>Any staff employed in the electrified area noticing sparking of wire near the
                              overhead contact wire at bridges, structures etc., shall report this at once to the
                              TPC. In the event of emergency circuit being cut-off, the nearest Station Master
                              shall be contacted immediately for informing the SCOR, who should advise the
                              TPC.</li>
                              <li>Whenever station staff notices a train worked by an electric engine passing with a
                              hot axle/any vehicle running in dangerous condition or smoke/fire emanating from
                              a vehicle or with any other abnormality in the running train which is likely to
                              endanger safety of the train/passengers, the Switchman/Station Master shall
                              immediately take steps to stop the train. In case they fail to stop such train by
                              normal means as laid down in G & SR, then, they shall immediately inform the
                              TPC either directly or through SCOR to switch off the power supply of the OHE of
                              the affected section under exchange of PNs. In case TPC has been directly
                              informed, SCOR has also to be informed subsequently.</li>
                              <li>Whenever any train gets held up for more than 5 minutes in the block section on
                              account of no tension, the Loco Pilot of the train shall depute his Assistant Loco
                              Pilot to check the train in order to look for any abnormality and to advise the
                              Guard of no tension in OHE. Together with the Assistant Loco Pilot, the Guard
                              shall check the entire train.
                              If, in the mean time, power supply is restored, the Loco Pilot shall call back his
                              Assistant Loco Pilot to the locomotive and resume journey. Otherwise, after the
                              train is checked, the Loco Pilot/Guard shall inform the SCOR/TPC of the details of
                              abnormality, if any, or otherwise, and assistance required, through the nearest
                              emergency telephone circuit or by other available means.
                              Further, the Loco Pilot and Guard shall arrange protection of the line affected in
                              accordance with Rule 6.03 and SRs there under. In case of Automatic signalling
                              territory, the line must be protected in accordance with Rule 9.10.
                              After ascertaining from the affected train of the nature of abnormality, decision
                              regarding re-charging of the OHE shall be taken by the SCOR in consultation with
                              CHC, Guard & Loco Pilot and then the concerned Station Masters shall be advised
                              accordingly. Necessary steps shall be taken by CHC, thereafter, for clearance of
                              the abnormality.</li>
                              <li>Restoration of OHE supply will be undertaken by TPC only on the advice of the
                              SCOR under exchange of PNs.</li>
                              <li>If the switching off of the OHE takes place at a graded section and there is a
                              chance that the train may start rolling, then the staff should also follow the
                              instructions laid down under SR. 6.04 to avoid rolling down of train.</li>

                                emergency phone of other line, Walkie-Talkie, level Crossing gate or through train
                                of other direction or by any other means of communication and act in accordance
                                with advice of control. In case no abnormality is noticed in his train, the Loco Pilot
                                should switch off the loco flasher.</li>
