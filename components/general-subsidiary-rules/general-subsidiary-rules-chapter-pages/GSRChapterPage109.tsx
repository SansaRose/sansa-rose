Unless it be otherwise directed by special instructions, one brake-van shall be attached to the rear of the train, provided that reserved carriages or other vehicles may, under special instructions, be placed in rear of such brake-van.

S.R.4.24.1. In the case of Express trains, a maximum of 2 coaches may be attached in rear of the rear brake-van (SLR). The brakes of such additional coaches must be in good working order. When necessary, an Officer&apos;s carriage can also be attached in addition to the 2 coaches in rear of the rear brake-van.

As a special case, on short distance passenger/mixed trains, working within zonal railway, to reduce the unnecessary shunting, SLR can be positioned in the middle of the composition. A maximum of 3 coaches (including an Officer&apos;s carriage) only is allowed in rear of rear SLR.

S.R. 4.24.2. In the case of goods trains, a maximum of 2 bogies or their equivalents may be attached in rear of the rear brake-van. When an Officer&apos;s carriage is to be attached, it will also be counted within the 2 bogies limit, as prescribed.

S.R. 4.24.3. In the case of Mixed and Goods trains, not worked with continuous air pressure, only an Inspection or Officer&apos;s carriage (bogie or otherwise) fitted with hand brake in good working order, which can be operated by its occupant during the run, may be attached in rear of the rear brake-van, provided that this shall not be permitted except under the written authority of the occupant, who shall be held personally responsible for safe working and for protecting his carriage in case the train parts between his carriage and the rearmost brakevan.

The Station Master may attach a damaged vehicle or damaged engine behind the rear brake-van of goods train during day light and in clear weather on receipt of written advice in duplicate from the TXR or the SSE/Loco, as the case may be. On sections where no goods trains are booked to run, the damaged vehicle or damaged engine may be attached behind the rear brake-van of a mixed train on the same conditions. A copy of the original advice should be handed over to the Guard of the train for submission along with the CTR. After sunset or if the weather is thick, foggy, or tempestuous impairing visibility, the damaged vehicle or damaged engine shall be detached from the train at a station en route and attached again to mixed or goods train during day light hours when the weather is clear. In case the damaged vehicle or damaged engine is detached at a station en route, the Guard of the train shall make over the original advice for attaching the said vehicle or damaged engine to the Station Master concerned for the latter to hand it over to the Guard of the train by which the damaged vehicle or damaged engine is subsequently dispatched.
