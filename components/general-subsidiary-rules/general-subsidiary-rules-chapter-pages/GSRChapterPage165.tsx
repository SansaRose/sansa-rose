                              The Flasher Light shall be switched off only when the Loco Pilot finds that his train is in a position to proceed or after it had been assured that the adjacent line, if any, is free from obstruction and it is not necessary to stop any approaching train to obtain assistance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The Loco Pilot or the Guard of the disabled train will then contact the SCOR/TPC through field/emergency phone or send the information through a messenger or through the Loco Pilot of an approaching train on the adjacent track, if any, about the occurrence and the assistance required, if any. He should also specifically indicate whether the other line, if any, is free and safe for the passage of trains.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The Loco Pilot of the train (diesel/electric) coming in the opposite direction on the adjacent track, if any, on seeing the flashing light will immediately acknowledge by switching &apos;on&apos; and &apos;off&apos; the flasher light, if provided on his engine 3 times. He shall immediately take action to stop his train short of the obstruction just as he would act when he sees a danger signal or hears the distress whistle code of another engine or explodes a detonator. Then he should reduce the speed of his train to 20 KMPH during day and when visibility is clear and 10 KMPH when visibility is not clear and during night time. He should approach the disabled train at such a restricted speed (not exceeding the speed limits mentioned above) that will enable him to stop his train short of any obstruction. He should then bring his train to a stop as near to the engine of the disabled train as possible and shall find out from the Loco Pilot of the latter the cause for putting on the flashing light and render all possible assistance to the affected train. He will continue his journey at normal speed, only after ascertaining that the line on which he is proceeding is free from any obstruction. If, however, he finds that the line on which he is to proceed is obstructed, the Loco Pilot and Guard of that train will protect their train by placing detonators etc., as per GR 6.03.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The Loco Pilot of the train proceeding on the adjacent track, if any, shall invariably stop at the next station and report the occurrence immediately and the assistance required.
