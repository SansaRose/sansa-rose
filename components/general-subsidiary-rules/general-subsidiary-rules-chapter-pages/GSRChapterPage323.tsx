                            <p>
                              Whenever emergency speed restrictions of less than 30 KMPH are required to be enforced
                              within one KM on either side of the neutral section, the permanent way staff shall
                              immediately arrange to protect the affected section on either side and take all steps to bring
                              to halt any train in rear of neutral section. The PWI shall also inform the nearest Station
                              Master regarding imposition of speed restriction. The Station Master shall inform the Station
                              Master at the other end of the neutral section, the SCOR and TPC. The SCOR and Station
                              Masters at either end of the neutral section shall not permit the entry of any electric
                              train/EMU into the section until an advice has been received from the TPC. The TPC shall
                              make immediate arrangements for energising the neutral section and provision of a
                              temporary neutral section. After this has been completed, movement of electric trains/EMUs
                              shall be permitted in accordance with S. R. 17.07.3. The Tr.D. official, who has jumpered the
                              neutral section, shall issue a Caution Order to the Loco Pilot of the train, if any which might
                              have been stopped in rear of the neutral section, advising him that he can pass the neutral
                              section, with power on and also informing him, if necessary, the locations at which he has,
                              to lower and raise pantograph at the temporary neutral section.
