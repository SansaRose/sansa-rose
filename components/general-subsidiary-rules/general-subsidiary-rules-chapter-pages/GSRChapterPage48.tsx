                    {`3.38. Points affecting movement of train.—
(1) The Station Master shall not give permission to take signals ‘off’ for a
train until-
(a) all facing points over which the train will pass are correctly set and
locked,
(b) all trailing points over which the train will pass are correctly set,
and
(c) the line over which the train is to pass is clear and free from
obstructions.
(2)When a running line is blocked by a stabled load, wagon, vehicle or by
a train which is to cross or give precedence to another train or
immediately after the arrival of a train at the station the points in rear
on double line sections and at either end on single line sections
should be immediately set against the blocked line except when
shunting or any other movement is required to be done immediately in
that direction on that line.
S.R.3.38.1The trailing points shall be correctly set or where the interlocking installation
requires it also locked.
S.R.3.38.2. During crossing of trains at key locked stations interlocked to standard-I and key
locked modified non-interlocked stations, the setting of the outermost trailing points against
the line on which the first train is to be received, does not constitute an obstruction for the
purpose of this rule.
S.R.3.38.3.1. At an interlocked station, a train may be allowed to run through a loop line with
1 in 8 ½ turnout, provided the points are correctly set and the signal taken ‘off’ and at a noninterlocked
station, in addition to this precaution, the train shall be brought to a halt at the
Outer signal and then the signals taken ‘off’. The Loco Pilot shall not exceed a speed limit of
10 kmph when running through a loop line at interlocked as well as non-interlocked stations.
When a run through train passes over a loop line, the authority to proceed shall be handed
over to the Loco Pilot opposite to the station building.
S.R.3.38.3.2. In no circumstance a train is to be allowed to run through an interlocked or a
non-interlocked station over a goods loop with 1 in 8 ½ turnouts. If it is necessary to pass a
non-stopping train over a goods loop with 1 in 8 ½ turnout it shall, first, be brought to a
stand on that line and then signals, if any taken ‘off’ and the authority to proceed handed
over to the Loco Pilot. At a non-interlocked station the train shall, in addition, be brought to a
halt at the Outer signal and then the signals taken ‘off’ for its admission.
S.R.3.38.3.3. Warning Boards have been provided at all 1 in 8 ½ turnouts for warning the
Loco Pilots to restrict the speed to 10 kmph.
S.R.3.38.4.1. At non-interlocked stations, bolts and cotters shall be provided for each switch
rail at all points on and giving access to running lines. One padlock shall be provided for
each such set of points.
S.R.3.38.4.2. The DEN is responsible for the provisions of bolts, cotters and padlocks and/or
clamps and padlocks for the points, when renewals and repairs are being carried out until the
points are formally handed over to traffic.
S.R.3.38.4.3. The DSTE is responsible for the provision of padlocks and/ or clamps at
stations when disconnection of the interlocking gear is taken up for the purpose of renewals,
repairs etc.
S.R.3.38.5.1. Line Blocked/Power Block caps are provided for the Control Panels at stations
and cabins. These Line Blocked/Power Blocked caps shall be placed on the
Signal/Point/Route knobs/ buttons to prevent the operation Signal/Point/Route knobs/
buttons and to give a visual warning to the Station Master. In VDU Panels facility to block a
line is provided through a pop-up message.
S.R.3.38.5.2.Line Blocked Caps bearing the words “Line Blocked” painted in white on in red
colour caps are intended for placing on the concerned Signal/Point/Route knobs/buttons of a
line on which a train or vehicle is left standing or otherwise obstructed. These Line Blocked
caps shall also be used when a train stops at a station to cross and/or to give precedence to
another train or trains. Power Block, Caps bearing the words “Power Block” painted in red on
Yellow colour caps, are intended for placing on the concerned Signal/Point/Route knobs/
buttons of a line on which Power Block is given. The Power Block caps shall be removed
only when the Power Block has been cleared.`}

                  If all lines at a station are blocked when line clear has already been granted, points should be set for the line occupied by a stabled load or, if not possible, by a goods train—so that, in case of mishap, the chances of casualties are minimized.
                  {"\n\n"}If all lines are occupied by passenger trains, points should be set for a loop line, where the speed of the incoming train will be reduced, thereby minimizing impact and casualties. Preferably, points should direct towards a loop line where the engine of the stationary train faces the direction of approach of the incoming train, rather than towards the loop line where a passenger coach would face the impact. These precautions must be observed along with the use of lever collars and other necessary safety measures.

                      <li>
                        If, after any operation, proper indications are not received, the Station Master on duty must inspect the points for physical obstruction, remove any obstruction found, and operate the points again from the cabin.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If points still cannot be set via the cabin, consider it a failure. The Station Master must break the box seal and use the emergency crank handle and padlock key for manual operation as follows:
                        <ul className="ml-6 list-disc pt-2">
                          <li>Unlock and remove the padlock from the point machine.</li>
                          <li>Insert the emergency crank handle and rotate it till it locks the points in the required position, in presence of the Station Master. Rotation must continue until the handle stops, indicating the points are correctly locked. Before inserting the crank handle, ensure the relevant point lever is in the needed position.</li>
                          <li>The Station Master is personally responsible for the correct setting of points. He must also ensure points are clamped, padlocked, and lever collars are applied before authorizing any train movement. Keys must remain in the Station Master&apos;s custody. Reception and dispatch are then arranged as per rules.</li>

                        Where crank handles are provided for manual operation or interlocked with signals, authority to pass signals is not needed if signals can be taken ‘off’ and ‘N’ or ‘R’ indications show the points are set and locked correctly. Points must still be clamped and padlocked by delegated staff before restoring the crank handle to the electrical lock and taking ‘off’ the relevant signals.

                          <li>A transportation staff member, not below Assistant Station Master rank, must operate and padlock the defective points.</li>
                          <li>A Private Number must be exchanged between the transportation staff at the site and the Assistant Station Master authorizing the signals, to confirm the points&apos; position and the crank handle&apos;s custody.</li>
                          <li>After manual operation, correct setting of points must be proven via the electrical circuit.</li>
