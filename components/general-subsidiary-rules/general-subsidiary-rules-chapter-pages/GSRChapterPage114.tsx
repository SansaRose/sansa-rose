In case an axle box is found running hot between stations, the train shall be brought to a stand immediately and the axle box examined by the Loco Pilot after opening the axle box face plate. The Loco Pilot should attend to the axle box and exercise his discretion with regard to the restricted speed at which it is safe for the vehicle to run.

After the arrival of the train at the station, the hot axle vehicle shall be examined by the C&W staff, where provided or by the Loco Pilot of the train. The wagon shall be detached if considered unsafe to run.

                      S. R. 4.29.5. In the event of any vehicle derailing or meeting with an accident, no repairs, except those absolutely necessary, shall be carried out. No such vehicle shall be worked away from the station at which the accident took place or to which it has been brought for stabling from the accident spot except with the permission of the DRM, as it is important, in the event of any enquiry, to have the vehicle as near the scene of the accident and in the same condition as possible. The vehicle, before being moved with the permission of the DRM, shall be examined and certified by the TXR as &apos;fit to run&apos;

                      S. R. 4.29.6. When a vehicle has been detached from a train due to defect or damage, the nearest TXR shall be advised. This vehicle shall be stabled and secured separately. Unnecessary shunting with or against such vehicle shall be avoided. The vehicle shall not be accepted again for traffic use or worked away from the station until certified fit by the TXR.
