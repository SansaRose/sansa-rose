                      <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-100">Scale I Accident Relief Medical Equipment</span> is a unit of the Accident Relief Train, stationed at divisional headquarters and other important stations, preferably where hospitals or health units are managed by Railway Medical Officers. Its main function is to transport medical personnel and equipment to accident sites, ensuring prompt medical aid and quick evacuation of injured persons to the nearest hospitals.

                      As far as possible, medical equipment or items likely to be required immediately for setting up a temporary field dressing station should be kept in numbered portable containers. Each container should have a printed card attached, displaying details of its contents.

                      The medical vehicle should be stabled in a siding open at both ends. While the Operating and Mechanical departments are responsible for positioning the medical vehicle for quick exit, the Medical department must also monitor its position. If the van is stabled in a way that could delay emergency movement, it should be immediately reported to the official in charge.
