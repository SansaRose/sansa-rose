Any attempt by Railway servants to seek redress from the court of law or such matters (even in cases where such a remedy is legally admissible ) without first exhausting the normal official channels of redress can only be regarded as contrary to official propriety and subversive of good discipline and may well justify the initiation of disciplinary action against them.
