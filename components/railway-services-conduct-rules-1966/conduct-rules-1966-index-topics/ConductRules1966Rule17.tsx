Except where such authority requires guidance or clarification from a higher authority, it shall consider and pass appropriate orders thereon. A railway servant desiring to seek the benefit of the Insolvency Act shall apply to the Head of his Department, or to such authority as the government may specify in this behalf, for permission to file a Schedule in a Court of Law. Same time, he shall explain in such form as the Government may prescribe in this behalf all the circumstances which led to his financial embarrassment. The said authority will then consider his case in the light of those circumstances.

Otherwise he should take steps either to dismiss or remove the employee from service as the circumstances of the case may warrant . If a railway servant asks for permission to seek the benefit of the Insolvency Act for second time such permission may not be granted by an authority lower than the General Manager or Head of Office who, if he decides to retain the employee in service, shall report the circumstances to the Railway Board for information. As the Railway Co-operative Credit is often the creditor in such a case and other railway servants are sureties for the debtor, the said authority will, in deciding whether or not the debtor should be retained in railway service, consider the effect of this dismissal or removal on the railway and on his fellow employees.
