                        Accident – Meaning. – Perusal of the Sec.82-A of the old Act shows that it contemplates liability of railway administration in respect of accidents to train carrying passengers. In particular it shows that the accident contemplated therein is an accident which has occurred due to other collision between trains of which one is a train carrying passengers, or the derailment of or other accidents to a train or any part of a train carrying passengers. The emphasis in Sec.82.A is upon the accident to the train . If there is an accident to the train as contemplated therein, then not withstanding the fact that there has been no wrongful act, neglect or default on the part of the railway administration, any passenger in such a train who has been injured or who has suffered loss in such accident to the train is entitled to maintain an action and recover compensation from the railway administration concerned, in respect of the injury or loss suffered by his. In the new Railway Act, the provisions in this regard are made in Sec.124 thereof.2

                        In the instant case, there is clearly an averment in the Claim Petition that when the appellant was about to board the Bangalore – Hyderabad Express train , a heavy iron girder which was loosely and carelessly fixed for electrification work, suddenly fell on the train and thereafter on the applicant resulting in grievous injuries to him. Since the learned counsel for the respondent disputes this avertment found in the Claim petition. The Court reserved liberty to the respondent to contest that position at the time of enquiry. However one thing is clear that if this averment is proved satisfactorily then a case is made out for the purpose of maintenance of this application under Sec.82.A of the Act, in as much as if, at the time of the applicant boarding the train, a heavy iron girder which was loosely and carelessly fixed for electrification work, fell suddenly on the train and then on him resulting in the injuries to him, it would amount to an &quot; accident&quot; coming with in the purview of Sec.82-A and not a &quot;mishap&quot; to the passenger. It clearly attracts category 3(iii) &quot;other accident to a train&quot;. Thus there is no doubt , that the Tribunal failed to apply its mind in considering the third category viz. &quot;other accident to a train&quot; in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India V.Sunil Kumar Ghosh.3

                        Whether a railway servant who is on duty is a passenger. _ In the case of T.T.E who was on duty at the relevant time, it cannot be said that he was traveling by that train without permission and in view of the matter he cannot be treated as an unauthorized passenger. The controversy whether a railway servant traveling on duty is a passenger for the purpose of the liability of the Railways has been set at rest by the Railway Act, 1989,wherein the explanation to Sec.124 of the Railways Act ,1989, corresponding to old Sec.82.A of the Indian Railways Act, includes a railway servant on duty as passenger. Thus, the petition of claimant for compensation under Sec.82-A was maintainable and claims commissioner committed error in taking contrary view.
